    <p class="subsubtitle">Above is a quick overview of every single listing in our dataset. It is colored by
      neighborhood and the size of each dot shows the price for that listing. This one is not interactible, but should
      give you an idea of the crazy amount of airbnb options that are available!</p>

    <p class="subtitle">New York is one of the coolest cities in the world (sorry, LA). Every year, millions of people
      visit the city to explore, meet friend, and have a good time.
      This got us curious.... Where do these people stay? Where SHOULD they stay? To feed our need for information, we
      looked around for any data available online that could show us different living options in NYC.
      That is when we found an interesting dataset from Kaggle containing various information on airbnb listings in NYC.
      After scanning through the dataset, we wanted to answer three main questions.</p>
    <div class="content">
      <ol type="1">
        <li>What are some of the most crazy and expensive airbnb listings in NYC?</li>
        <li>How do airbnb's average prices changes depending on how close they are to popular landmarks?</li>
        <li>Which neighborhoods have the most expensive airbnbs?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="subtitle">As you continue to scroll down this page of colors, graphs, and information, you'll find the
      answers we came up with the visualizations we created. Each of the following section focuses on one of our three
      questions (don't worry, they are in order) and tries to provide you with some hopefully helpful information for
    your travels. Enjoy!</p>

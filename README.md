This project serves as an exploration of airbnb data in NYC. We wanted to compare the price of listings to other aspects. Here are the three main questions that our website answers.

1. What are some of the most crazy and expensive airbnb listings in NYC?
2. How do airbnb's average prices changes depending on how close they are to popular
landmarks?
3. Which neighborhoods have the most expensive airbnb's?

This project was completed in Lane Harrison's Dataviz class at WPI.
